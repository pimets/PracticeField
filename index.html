            <p style="color: brown; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;"> Cool, cosmopolitan, crowded, constantly evolving … the Big Apple blends big city splendor with small-town charm. Amid Gotham's iconic landmarks and towering skyscrapers, you'll experience a vibrant culture permeating each of the city's distinctive neighborhoods and boroughs. Follow trendsetters to the East Village and Brooklyn to check out indie boutiques, iconic bakeries and trendy coffee shops. Afterward, peruse the racks of the sleek shops lining Fifth Avenue, admire the cutting-edge art collections at the MoMA and the Met, catch a memorable show on Broadway or sit down for a meal at the latest "it" restaurant.</p>

                <h3 style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Fall in NY</h3>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Autumn is a magical time in New York City. Reinvigorated by the chill in the air, many head outdoors to see the leaves change across all five boroughs. Layer up and enjoy a classic NYC pastime: wandering through Central Park. You can always retreat to a cozy café; or one of the City’s museums and cultural attractions, many of which have new exhibitions debuting in the fall. It’s also an ideal time to catch some nail-biting baseball or a recently opened Broadway show.</p>

                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;"><strong>World Trade Center Transportation Hub</strong><br>
                    The Santiago Calatrava–designed World Trade Center Transportation Hub opened in the spring of 2016. From its initial design through to its final completion, the project proved to be arduous for its symbolism, its physical complexity, as well as for the number of commuters it would need to accommodate. The interior of the Oculus (as it’s commonly known) opened the Westfield World Trade Center mall in the summer of 2016. The 365,000 square feet of retail space accommodates some 113 tenants.</p>
